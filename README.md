# BeeHive
An AI based social science model that explores the dynamics of knowledge sharing and deception within a population of individuals.

The model consists of a group of N individual bees, some of whom are honest and some are mutant liars.
Individuals share common knowledge (propositional truths marked as C_n) and personal knowledge (Hooare triplets marked as K_n), and they communicate with each other.
During communication, individuals exchange knowledge, and the receiving individual updates its memory to include the new knowledge after some reflection.
Mutants have a lying function that determines whether to tell a lie based on the potential benefits and risks.
Mutants also evaluate the information received from others to determine if it benefits them to consider it a lie.
Mutants face negative consequences, such as reduced lifespan, if they are caught lying or misjudge others' lies. They also will have less chance to particiapate in communication due to longer processing periods.
Individuals reproduce randomly, passing on their traits, including honesty or lying tendencies and their knowledge bases, to their offspring.
The model includes the concept of "common knowledge" when a personal knowledge is present in the memory of all individuals.
The model allows for the creation of Hooare logic triplets with random preconditions and consequences.
This is a simplified summary of the model. It involves the dynamics of knowledge exchange, the behavior of liars, and the evolution of traits through reproduction.
